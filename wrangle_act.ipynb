    "\n",
    "* You only want original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.\n",
    "* Assessing and cleaning the entire dataset completely would require a lot of time, and is not necessary to practice and demonstrate your skills in data wrangling. Therefore, the requirements of this project are only to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues in this dataset.\n",
    "* The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This [unique rating system](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent) is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.\n",
